GUI Application to present the Data FrSky Telemetry downlink data for my DIY Antenna project in 
a more easily accessible format.

See https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky for more details of the downlink.
See my other Github projects for further code associated with the project.

The FrSky Telemetry data is read from the serial port ( or USB port using a Serial port emulator/ driver)
